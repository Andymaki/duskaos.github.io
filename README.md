# DuskaOS

⚠️ WARNING: Duska OS is an experimental project created and maintained by a single 14-year-old indie developer. This is not a product of a company or large group (unlike Ubuntu, SUSE, Fedora, etc.). Expect bugs, incomplete features, and very limited packages in the repository. By installing, you acknowledge you may face kernel issues, graphics or timezone misconfigurations, and other errors. Use at your own risk and contribute feedback to help improve the project.
🔧 Introduction

Duska OS is an independent Linux distribution built from Gentoo sources but redesigned with its own philosophy and tools. It features a minimal base install and a custom package retriever called Lemon. The goal is to offer:

    🛠 Full customization without overwhelming complexity
    🧑‍💻 A learning-friendly environment for programmers and Linux enthusiasts
    🔧 A lightweight core, with optional graphical environments available via Lemon
    🎯 An evolving, community-driven platform — new features added based on user feedback

This project is driven by passion and curiosity. It is entirely the work of one young developer, inspired by the DIY spirit of early Linux pioneers. While Duska OS aims to grow, for now it remains a personal, experimental journey into Linux development.
